# TimeToken Platform Architecture

## System Overview
TimeToken is a platform that enables users to tokenize their time as a tradable currency. Users can offer services, trade time tokens, and participate in a time-based economy.

## Core Components

### Backend (Rust)
- **Authentication Service**: User registration, login, and session management
- **Token Management**: Creation, transfer, and burning of time tokens
- **Service Marketplace**: Platform for users to offer and request services
- **Smart Contracts**: Rules for token exchange and service fulfillment
- **Reputation System**: Trust metrics for users based on completed transactions
- **Escrow Service**: Hold tokens in escrow until services are verified as complete

### Frontend (React)
- **User Dashboard**: Token balance, transaction history, and profile management
- **Marketplace UI**: Browse, filter, and search for available services
- **Service Listing**: Create and manage service offerings
- **Transaction Interface**: Initiate, accept, and complete token exchanges
- **Reputation Display**: View and filter users by reputation scores
- **Notification System**: Updates on transactions, service requests, and offers

### Data Model

#### User
- `user_id`: Unique identifier
- `username`: Display name
- `email`: Contact information
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `reputation_score`: Trust metric (0-100)
- `skills`: Array of services they can provide
- `availability`: Calendar of available time slots

#### TimeToken
- `token_id`: Unique identifier
- `issuer_id`: User who created the token
- `denomination`: Time value (minutes/hours)
- `creation_date`: When the token was minted
- `expiration_date`: Optional expiry (to prevent hoarding)
- `current_owner`: Who currently holds the token
- `transfer_history`: Record of previous owners

#### Service
- `service_id`: Unique identifier
- `provider_id`: User offering the service
- `title`: Name of the service
- `description`: Detailed explanation
- `time_cost`: Token amount required
- `categories`: Service classification tags
- `rating`: Average quality score from previous clients

#### Transaction
- `transaction_id`: Unique identifier
- `buyer_id`: User paying tokens
- `seller_id`: User receiving tokens
- `service_id`: Related service (if applicable)
- `token_ids`: Tokens being transferred
- `status`: Pending, In Progress, Completed, Disputed
- `start_time`: When the transaction began
- `completion_time`: When the service was delivered
- `feedback`: Ratings and comments

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Rust
- **Web Framework**: Actix-web
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Diesel or SQLx
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **API Format**: RESTful + WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Blockchain Integration**: Optional substrate framework for token security

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- **API Client**: Axios or Fetch API
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
- **Calendar Integration**: React-Big-Calendar for availability scheduling

## Security Considerations
- **Token Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of token authenticity
- **Double-spending Prevention**: Transactional database operations
- **Dispute Resolution**: Escrow system with arbitration mechanisms
- **Data Privacy**: Encryption of sensitive user information
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of API abuse
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs

## Key Features
1. **Time Banking**: Exchange services based on time rather than traditional currency
2. **Skill Marketplace**: Match providers with those seeking their skills
3. **Community Building**: Foster connections between users with complementary needs
4. **Value Transparency**: Clear pricing based on time units rather than arbitrary values
5. **Verified Transactions**: Confirmation system to ensure service delivery
6. **Flexible Denominations**: Support for minutes, hours, or days as token units
